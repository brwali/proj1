Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing|1 |Present, but not much effort put into this.
Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code.| 3|video is 2 minutes

# Reflection

One difficulty that was encountered in the installation process was that several dependencies were out of date. When following the instructions one of the commands that is given to install all the dependencies fast was 
``
pip install -r requirements.txt
``, which installed the dependencies and the version number that the previous group was using. While this did lead to the bot running, it did not allow the bot to run properly as the commands for the bot were not being recognized when I typed them into the discord server. This was ultimately because the discord.py dependency on requirements.txt was out of date and after I had updated that dependency all the commands were being recognized. This could have been avoided if in the installation instructions there was an FAQ section at the bottom with one of the first entries to be to try and update all dependencies first if there was a runtime issue.

Another issue that arose while trying to complete the installation process for ClassMateBot was figuring out which version of each program to download. There were many different systems, applications, and programs involved, including Heroku, PostgreSQL, Python, and Discord. These all had to be installed and utilzed with the correct version for them to work together properly. Specifically with PostgreSQL, the newest version (16) did not work with the system in place. The instructions also did not specify which version needed to be installed until after the step involving the installation of PostgreSQL. In a later step, the reader was informed that they needed to check the version to ensure that it matched the version of a different program already in place. At this point, I was forced to reinstall PostgreSQL with a different version and redo many set-up steps to ensure that everything worked together properly. This could have been avoided by linking the reader to the download page of each program and giving precise instructions as to which version to use.

Another problem that we ran into was not having the bot running when it was being added to the server. Despite the instructions explicitly stating to ensure that it was running, this was overlooked by multiple of our group members during our set up. This was the last step of the instructions, so we felt as though we were complete. It only stopped some of the commands from running, so we did not realize what our issue was for a while. I think to avoid this pain, first we have learned the lesson to be more careful installation instruction readers, but also perhaps we will write our instructions in a way that important details that are easy to overlook like this are hard to miss. We could do a test run by having a group of friends go through the installation guide, and any components that they struggle with or miss we could take note of to improve the guide.
